            <h2 className="about_bio_desc">
                My name is Abraham Hernandez. I'm a Spanish-American with a
                Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the
                Rochester Institute of Technology. Raised in San Rafael,
                California, I developed my passion for programming early on and
                am currently working as a full time software developer for More
                Vang.
            </h2>
            <h2 className="about_bio_desc">
                One of my biggest goals is to give back by helping students
                discover and pursue careers in tech. Growing up in San Rafael, I
                didn't have many resources or mentors to guide me into Computer
                Scienceâ€”I had to figure out a lot on my own. That experience
                showed me how important it is to have support and guidance when
                you're just starting out. I want to make sure the next
                generation of students has access to the tools, knowledge, and
                encouragement they need to thrive as developers, especially
                those from underrepresented or underserved communities who might
                face similar barriers that I did.
            </h2>
            <h2 className="about_bio_desc">
                Some of the languages and tech I've worked with include Python,
                Java/TypeScript, C, React, React Native, Gitlab, and Docker.
                Outside of programming, I also love gardening, reading sci-fi
                books, and listening to 90's rock!
